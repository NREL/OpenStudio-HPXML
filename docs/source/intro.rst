Introduction
============

The OpenStudio-HPXML project consists of an `OpenStudio measure <http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/getting_started/about_measures/>`_ that converts a residential `HPXML file <https://hpxml.nrel.gov>`_ to an OpenStudio/EnergyPlus model.

The EnergyPlus simulation engine is like a Swiss army knife.
There are often multiple models available for the same building technology with varying trade-offs between accuracy and speed.
This OpenStudio measure standardizes the use of EnergyPlus (e.g., the choice of models appropriate for residential buildings) to provide a fast and easy to use solution.
