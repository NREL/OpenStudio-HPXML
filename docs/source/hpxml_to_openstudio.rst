HPXMLtoOpenStudio Measure
=========================

The HPXMLtoOpenStudio measure requires a building description in an `HPXML file <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/>`_ format.
HPXML is an open data standard for collecting and transferring home energy data. 
Using HPXML files reduces the complexity and effort for software developers to leverage the EnergyPlus simulation engine.

EnergyPlus Use Case for HPXML
-----------------------------

HPXML is an flexible and extensible format, where nearly all elements in the schema are optional and custom elements can be included.
Because of this, an EnergyPlus Use Case for HPXML has been developed that specifies the HPXML elements or enumeration choices required to run the measure.

Software developers should use the EnergyPlus Use Case (found at ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/EPvalidator.rb``, which defines sets of conditional XPath expressions) as well as the HPXML schema (HPXML.xsd) to construct valid HPXML files for EnergyPlus simulations.

The `HPXML Toolbox website <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/>`_ also provides several resources for software developers, including:

#. An interactive schema validator
#. A data dictionary
#. An implementation guide

Simulation Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EnergyPlus simulation controls can be entered in ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/SimulationControl``.

The simulation controls currently offered are timestep, begin month, begin day of month, end month, and end day of month.

Timestep can be optionally provided as ``Timestep``, where the value is in minutes and must be a divisor of 60.
If not provided, the default value of 60 is used.

The simulation run period can be optionally specified with ``BeginMonth``/``BeginDayOfMonth`` and/or ``EndMonth``/``EndDayOfMonth``.
The ``BeginMonth``/``BeginDayOfMonth`` provided must occur before ``EndMonth``/``EndDayOfMonth`` provided (e.g., a run period from 10/1 to 3/31 is invalid).
If not provided, default values of January 1st and December 31st will be used.

Building Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The building description is entered in HPXML's ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails``.

Building Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes elements specified in HPXML's ``BuildingSummary``. 
It is used for high-level building information including conditioned floor area, number of bedrooms, number of residents, number of conditioned floors, etc.
Most occupancy assumptions are based on the number of bedrooms, while the number of residents is solely used to determine heat gains from the occupants themselves.
Note that a walkout basement should be included in ``NumberofConditionedFloorsAboveGrade``.

If ``NumberofBathrooms`` is not provided, it is calculated using the following equation based on the `Building America House Simulation Protocols <https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/building_america/house_simulation.pdf>`_.

.. math:: NumberofBathrooms = \frac{NumberofBedrooms}{2} + 0.5

Shading due to neighboring buildings can be defined inside an ``Site/extension/Neighbors`` element.
Each ``Neighbors/NeighborBuilding`` element is required to have an ``Azimuth`` and ``Distance`` from the house.
A ``Height`` is also optionally allowed; if not provided, the neighbor is assumed to be the same height as the house.

The local shelter coefficient can be entered as ``Site/extension/ShelterCoefficient``.
The shelter coefficient is defined by the AIM-2 infiltration model to account for nearby buildings, trees and obstructions.
If not provided, the value of 0.5 will be assumed.

===================  =========================================================================
Shelter Coefficient  Description
===================  =========================================================================
1.0                  No obstructions or local shielding
0.9                  Light local shielding with few obstructions within two building heights
0.7                  Local shielding with many large obstructions within two building heights
0.5                  Heavily shielded, many large obstructions within one building height
0.3                  Complete shielding with large buildings immediately adjacent
===================  =========================================================================

The terrain surrounding the building is assumed to be suburban.

Weather File
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ClimateandRiskZones/WeatherStation`` element specifies the EnergyPlus weather file (EPW) to be used in the simulation.
The weather file can be entered in one of two ways:

#. Using ``WeatherStation/WMO``, which must be one of the acceptable TMY3 WMO station numbers found in the ``weather/data.csv`` file.
   The full set of U.S. TMY3 weather files can be `downloaded here <https://data.nrel.gov/files/128/tmy3s-cache-csv.zip>`_.
#. Using ``WeatherStation/extension/EPWFilePath``.

Enclosure
~~~~~~~~~

This section describes elements specified in HPXML's ``Enclosure``.

All surfaces that bound different space types in the building (i.e., not just thermal boundary surfaces) must be specified in the HPXML file.
For example, an attached garage would generally be defined by walls adjacent to conditioned space, walls adjacent to outdoors, a slab, and a roof or ceiling.
For software tools that do not collect sufficient inputs for every required surface, the software developers will need to make assumptions about these surfaces or collect additional input.

The space types used in the HPXML building description are:

============================  ===================================
Space Type                    Notes
============================  ===================================
living space                  Above-grade conditioned floor area.
attic - vented            
attic - unvented          
basement - conditioned        Below-grade conditioned floor area.
basement - unconditioned  
crawlspace - vented       
crawlspace - unvented     
garage                    
other housing unit            Used to specify adiabatic surfaces.
============================  ===================================

.. warning::

  It is the software tool's responsibility to provide the appropriate building surfaces. 
  While some error-checking is in place, it is not possible to know whether some surfaces are incorrectly missing.

Also note that wall and roof surfaces do not require an azimuth to be specified. 
Rather, only the windows/skylights themselves require an azimuth. 
Thus, software tools can choose to use a single wall (or roof) surface to represent multiple wall (or roof) surfaces for the entire building if all their other properties (construction type, interior/exterior adjacency, etc.) are identical.

Air Leakage
***********

Building air leakage characterized by air changes per hour or cfm at 50 pascals pressure difference (ACH50 or CFM50) is entered at ``Enclosure/AirInfiltration/AirInfiltrationMeasurement/BuildingAirLeakage/AirLeakage``.
The ``Enclosure/AirInfiltration/AirInfiltrationMeasurement`` should be specified with ``HousePressure='50'`` and ``BuildingAirLeakage/UnitofMeasure='ACH'`` or ``BuildingAirLeakage/UnitofMeasure='CFM'``.

In addition, the building's volume associated with the air leakage measurement can be provided in HPXML's ``AirInfiltrationMeasurement/InfiltrationVolume``.
If not provided, the infiltration volume is assumed to be equal to the conditioned building volume.

Vented Attics/Crawlspaces
*************************

The ventilation rate for vented attics (or crawlspaces) can be specified using an ``Attic`` (or ``Foundation``) element.
First, define the ``AtticType`` as ``Attic[Vented='true']`` (or ``FoundationType`` as ``Crawlspace[Vented='true']``).
Then use the ``VentilationRate[UnitofMeasure='SLA']/Value`` element to specify a specific leakage area (SLA).
If these elements are not provided, default values of 1/300 for vented attics and 1/150 for vented crawlspaces will be used based on `ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2019 <https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/RESNETICC3012019>`_.

Roofs
*****

Pitched or flat roof surfaces that are exposed to ambient conditions should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Roofs/Roof``. 
For a multifamily building where the dwelling unit has another dwelling unit above it, the surface between the two dwelling units should be considered a ``FrameFloor`` and not a ``Roof``.

Beyond the specification of typical heat transfer properties (insulation R-value, solar absorptance, emittance, etc.), note that roofs can be defined as having a radiant barrier.

Walls
*****

Any wall that has no contact with the ground and bounds a space type should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Walls/Wall``. 
Interior walls (for example, walls solely within the conditioned space of the building) are not required.

Walls are primarily defined by their ``Insulation/AssemblyEffectiveRValue``.
The choice of ``WallType`` has a secondary effect on heat transfer in that it informs the assumption of wall thermal mass.

Rim Joists
**********

Rim joists, the perimeter of floor joists typically found between stories of a building or on top of a foundation wall, are specified as an ``Enclosure//RimJoists/RimJoist``.

The ``InteriorAdjacentTo`` element should typically be "living space" for rim joists between stories of a building and "basement - conditioned", "basement - unconditioned", "crawlspace - vented", or "crawlspace - unvented" for rim joists on top of a foundation wall.

Foundation Walls
****************

Any wall that is in contact with the ground should be specified as an ``Enclosure/FoundationWalls/FoundationWall``.
Other walls (e.g., wood framed walls) that are connected to a below-grade space but have no contact with the ground should be specified as ``Walls`` and not ``FoundationWalls``.

*Exterior* foundation walls (i.e., those that fall along the perimeter of the building's footprint) should use "ground" for ``ExteriorAdjacentTo`` and the appropriate space type (e.g., "basement - unconditioned") for ``InteriorAdjacentTo``.

*Interior* foundation walls should be specified with two appropriate space types (e.g., "crawlspace - vented" and "garage", or "basement - unconditioned" and "crawlspace - unvented") for ``InteriorAdjacentTo`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo``.
Interior foundation walls should never use "ground" for ``ExteriorAdjacentTo`` even if the foundation wall has some contact with the ground due to the difference in below-grade depths of the two adjacent space types.

Foundations must include a ``Height`` as well as a ``DepthBelowGrade``. 
For exterior foundation walls, the depth below grade is relative to the ground plane.
For interior foundation walls, the depth below grade **should not** be thought of as relative to the ground plane, but rather as the depth of foundation wall in contact with the ground.
For example, an interior foundation wall between an 8 ft conditioned basement and a 3 ft crawlspace has a height of 8 ft and a depth below grade of 5 ft.
Alternatively, an interior foundation wall between an 8 ft conditioned basement and an 8 ft unconditioned basement has a height of 8 ft and a depth below grade of 0 ft.

Foundation wall insulation can be described in two ways: 

Option 1. Both interior and exterior continuous insulation layers with ``NominalRValue``, ``extension/DistanceToTopOfInsulation``, and ``extension/DistanceToBottomOfInsulation``. 
Insulation layers are particularly useful for describing foundation wall insulation that doesn't span the entire height (e.g., 4 ft of insulation for an 8 ft conditioned basement). 
If there is not insulation on the interior and/or exterior of the foundation wall, the continuous insulation layer must still be provided -- with the nominal R-value, etc., set to zero.
When insulation is specified with option 1, it is modeled with a concrete wall (whose ``Thickness`` is provided) as well as air film resistances as appropriate.

Option 2. An ``AssemblyEffectiveRValue``. 
The assembly effective R-value should include the concrete wall and an interior air film resistance. 
The exterior air film resistance (for any above-grade exposure) or any soil thermal resistance should **not** be included.

Frame Floors
************

Any horizontal floor/ceiling surface that is not in contact with the ground (Slab) nor adjacent to ambient conditions above (Roof) should be specified as an ``Enclosure/FrameFloors/FrameFloor``.

Frame floors are primarily defined by their ``Insulation/AssemblyEffectiveRValue``.

Slabs
*****

Any space type that borders the ground should include an ``Enclosure/Slabs/Slab`` surface with the appropriate ``InteriorAdjacentTo``. 
This includes basements, crawlspaces (even when there are dirt floors -- use zero for the ``Thickness``), garages, and slab-on-grade foundations.

A primary input for a slab is its ``ExposedPerimeter``. 
The exposed perimeter should include any slab length that falls along the perimeter of the building's footprint (i.e., is exposed to ambient conditions).
So, a basement slab edge adjacent to a garage or crawlspace, for example, should not be included.

Vertical insulation adjacent to the slab can be described by a ``PerimeterInsulation/Layer/NominalRValue`` and a ``PerimeterInsulationDepth``.

Horizontal insulation under the slab can be described by a ``UnderSlabInsulation/Layer/NominalRValue``. 
The insulation can either have a fixed width (``UnderSlabInsulationWidth``) or can span the entire slab (``UnderSlabInsulationSpansEntireSlab``).

For foundation types without walls, the ``DepthBelowGrade`` element must be provided.
For foundation types with walls, the ``DepthBelowGrade`` element is not used; instead the slab's position relative to grade is determined by the ``FoundationWall/DepthBelowGrade`` values.

Windows
*******

Any window or glass door area should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Windows/Window``.

Windows are defined by *full-assembly* NFRC ``UFactor`` and ``SHGC``, as well as ``Area``.
Windows must reference a HPXML ``Enclosures/Walls/Wall`` element via the ``AttachedToWall``.
Windows must also have an ``Azimuth`` specified, even if the attached wall does not.

In addition, the summer/winter interior shading coefficients can be optionally entered as ``InteriorShading/SummerShadingCoefficient`` and ``InteriorShading/WinterShadingCoefficient``.
The summer interior shading coefficient must be less than or equal to the winter interior shading coefficient.
Note that a value of 0.7 indicates a 30% reduction in solar gains (i.e., 30% shading).
If not provided, default values of 0.70 for summer and 0.85 for winter will be used based on `ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2019 <https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/RESNETICC3012019>`_.

Overhangs (e.g., a roof eave) can optionally be defined for a window by specifying a ``Window/Overhangs`` element.
Overhangs are defined by the vertical distance between the overhang and the top of the window (``DistanceToTopOfWindow``), and the vertical distance between the overhang and the bottom of the window (``DistanceToBottomOfWindow``).
The difference between these two values equals the height of the window.

Finally, windows can be optionally described with ``FractionOperable``.
The input should solely reflect whether the windows are operable (can be opened), not how they are used by the occupants.
If a ``Window`` represents a single window, the value should be 0 or 1.
If a ``Window`` represents multiple windows (e.g., 4), the value should be between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1).
If not provided, it is assumed that 67% of the windows are operable.
The total open window area for natural ventilation is thus calculated using A) the fraction of windows that are operable, B) the assumption that 50% of the area of operable windows can be open, and C) the assumption that 20% of that openable area is actually opened by occupants whenever outdoor conditions are favorable for cooling.

Skylights
*********

Any skylight should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Skylights/Skylight``.

Skylights are defined by *full-assembly* NFRC ``UFactor`` and ``SHGC``, as well as ``Area``.
Skylights must reference a HPXML ``Enclosures/Roofs/Roof`` element via the ``AttachedToRoof``.
Skylights must also have an ``Azimuth`` specified, even if the attached roof does not.

Doors
*****

Any opaque doors should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Doors/Door``.

Doors are defined by ``RValue`` and ``Area``.
Doors must reference a HPXML ``Enclosures/Walls/Wall`` element via the ``AttachedToWall``.
Doors must also have an ``Azimuth`` specified, even if the attached wall does not.

Systems
~~~~~~~

This section describes elements specified in HPXML's ``Systems``.

If any HVAC systems are entered that provide heating (or cooling), the sum of all their ``FractionHeatLoadServed`` (or ``FractionCoolLoadServed``) values must be less than or equal to 1.
For example, a room air conditioner might be specified with ``FractionCoolLoadServed`` equal to 0.3 if it serves 30% of the home's conditioned floor area.

If any water heating systems are entered, the sum of all their ``FractionDHWLoadServed`` values must be equal to 1.

.. note:: 

  HVAC systems (Heating Systems, Cooling Systems, and Heat Pumps) can be autosized via ACCA Manual J/S by using -1 as the capacity.
  For a given system, all capacities must either be autosized or user-specified.
  For example, an air-to-air heat pump must have its heating capacity, cooling capacity, and backup heating capacity all autosized or user-specified.

Heating Systems
***************

Each heating system (other than heat pumps) should be entered as a ``Systems/HVAC/HVACPlant/HeatingSystem``.
Inputs including ``HeatingSystemType``, ``HeatingCapacity``, and ``FractionHeatLoadServed`` must be provided.

Depending on the type of heating system specified, additional elements are required:

==================  ===========================  =================  =======================

If a non-electric heating system is specified, the ``ElectricAuxiliaryEnergy`` element may be provided if available. 

Cooling Systems
***************

Each cooling system (other than heat pumps) should be entered as a ``Systems/HVAC/HVACPlant/CoolingSystem``.
Inputs including ``CoolingSystemType`` and ``FractionCoolLoadServed`` must be provided.
``CoolingCapacity`` must also be provided for all systems other than evaporative coolers.

Depending on the type of cooling system specified, additional elements are required/available:

=======================  =================================  =================  =======================  ====================
CoolingSystemType        DistributionSystem                 CoolingSystemFuel  AnnualCoolingEfficiency  SensibleHeatFraction

evaporative cooler       AirDistribution or DSE (optional)  electricity
=======================  =================================  =================  =======================  ====================

Central air conditioners can also have the ``CompressorType`` specified; if not provided, it is assumed as follows:

- "single stage": SEER <= 15
- "two stage": 15 < SEER <= 21
- "variable speed": SEER > 21

Heat Pumps
**********

Each heat pump should be entered as a ``Systems/HVAC/HVACPlant/HeatPump``.
Inputs including ``HeatPumpType``, ``CoolingCapacity``, ``HeatingCapacity``, ``FractionHeatLoadServed``, and ``FractionCoolLoadServed`` must be provided.
Note that heat pumps are allowed to provide only heating (``FractionCoolLoadServed`` = 0) or cooling (``FractionHeatLoadServed`` = 0) if appropriate.

Depending on the type of heat pump specified, additional elements are required/available:

=============  =================================  ============  =======================  =======================  ===========================  ==================

=============  =================================  ============  =======================  =======================  ===========================  ==================

Air-to-air heat pumps can also have the ``CompressorType`` specified; if not provided, it is assumed as follows:

- "single stage": SEER <= 15
- "two stage": 15 < SEER <= 21
- "variable speed": SEER > 21

If the heat pump has backup heating, it can be specified with ``BackupSystemFuel``, ``BackupAnnualHeatingEfficiency``, and ``BackupHeatingCapacity``.
If the heat pump has a switchover temperature (e.g., dual-fuel heat pump) where the heat pump stops operating and the backup heating system starts running, it can be specified with ``BackupHeatingSwitchoverTemperature``.
If the ``BackupHeatingSwitchoverTemperature`` is not provided, the backup heating system will operate as needed when the heat pump has insufficient capacity.

Thermostat
**********

A ``Systems/HVAC/HVACControl`` must be provided if any HVAC systems are specified.
The heating setpoint (``SetpointTempHeatingSeason``) and cooling setpoint (``SetpointTempCoolingSeason``) are required elements.

If there is a heating setback, it is defined with:

- ``SetbackTempHeatingSeason``: Temperature during heating setback
- ``extension/SetbackStartHourHeating``: The start hour of the heating setback where 0=midnight and 12=noon
- ``TotalSetbackHoursperWeekHeating``: The number of hours of heating setback per week

If there is a cooling setup, it is defined with:

- ``SetupTempCoolingSeason``: Temperature during cooling setup
- ``extension/SetupStartHourCooling``: The start hour of the cooling setup where 0=midnight and 12=noon
- ``TotalSetupHoursperWeekCooling``: The number of hours of cooling setup per week

Finally, if there are sufficient ceiling fans present that result in a reduced cooling setpoint, this offset can be specified with ``extension/CeilingFanSetpointTempCoolingSeasonOffset``.

HVAC Distribution
*****************

Each separate HVAC distribution system should be specified as a ``Systems/HVAC/HVACDistribution``.
There should be at most one heating system and one cooling system attached to a distribution system.
See the sections on Heating Systems, Cooling Systems, and Heat Pumps for information on which ``DistributionSystemType`` is allowed for which HVAC system.
Also, note that some HVAC systems (e.g., room air conditioners) are not allowed to be attached to a distribution system.

``AirDistribution`` systems are defined by:

- Supply leakage to the outside in CFM25 or percent of airflow (``DuctLeakageMeasurement[DuctType='supply']/DuctLeakage/Value``)
- Optional return leakage to the outside in CFM25 or percent of airflow (``DuctLeakageMeasurement[DuctType='return']/DuctLeakage/Value``)
- Optional supply ducts (``Ducts[DuctType='supply']``)
- Optional return ducts (``Ducts[DuctType='return']``)

For each duct, ``DuctInsulationRValue``, ``DuctLocation``, and ``DuctSurfaceArea`` must be provided.

``HydronicDistribution`` systems do not require any additional inputs.

``DSE`` systems are defined by a ``AnnualHeatingDistributionSystemEfficiency`` and ``AnnualCoolingDistributionSystemEfficiency`` elements.

.. warning::

  Specifying a DSE for the HVAC distribution system will NOT be reflected in the raw EnergyPlus simulation outputs, but IS reflected by the SimulationOutputReport reporting measure.

Mechanical Ventilation
**********************

A single whole-house mechanical ventilation system may be specified as a ``Systems/MechanicalVentilation/VentilationFans/VentilationFan`` with ``UsedForWholeBuildingVentilation='true'``.
Inputs including ``FanType``, ``TestedFlowRate`` (or ``RatedFlowRate``), ``HoursInOperation``, and ``FanPower`` must be provided.

Depending on the type of mechanical ventilation specified, additional elements are required:

====================================  ==========================  =======================  ================================

====================================  ==========================  =======================  ================================

Note that AdjustedSensibleRecoveryEfficiency and AdjustedTotalRecoveryEfficiency can be provided instead.

In many situations, the rated flow rate should be the value derived from actual testing of the system.
For a CFIS system, the rated flow rate should equal the amount of outdoor air provided to the distribution system.

Kitchen Fan
***********

A kitchen range fan may be specified as a ``Systems/MechanicalVentilation/VentilationFans/VentilationFan`` with ``FanLocation='kitchen'`` and ``UsedForLocalVentilation='true'``.

Additional fields may be provided per the table below. If not provided, default values will be assumed based on the `Building America House Simulation Protocols <https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/building_america/house_simulation.pdf>`_.

Whole House Fan
***************

A single whole house fan may be specified as a ``Systems/MechanicalVentilation/VentilationFans/VentilationFan`` with ``UsedForSeasonalCoolingLoadReduction='true'``.
Required elements include ``RatedFlowRate`` and ``FanPower``.

The whole house fan is assumed to operate during hours of favorable outdoor conditions.
If available, it will take priority over natural ventilation.

Water Heaters
*************

Each water heater should be entered as a ``Systems/WaterHeating/WaterHeatingSystem``.
Inputs including ``WaterHeaterType`` and ``FractionDHWLoadServed`` must be provided.
The water heater ``Location`` can be optionally entered; if not provided, a default water heater location will be assumed based on IECC climate zone. 

+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Validating & Debugging Errors
-----------------------------

When running HPXML files, errors may occur because:

#. An HPXML file provided is invalid (either relative to the HPXML schema or the EnergyPlus Use Case).
#. An unexpected EnergyPlus simulation error occurred.

If an error occurs, first look in the run.log for details.
If there are no errors in that log file, then the error may be in the EnergyPlus simulation -- see eplusout.err.

Contact us if you can't figure out the cause of an error.

Sample Files
------------

Dozens of sample HPXML files are included in the workflow/sample_files directory.
The sample files help to illustrate how different building components are described in HPXML.

Each sample file generally makes one isolated change relative to the base HPXML (base.xml) building.
For example, the base-dhw-dwhr.xml file adds a ``DrainWaterHeatRecovery`` element to the building.

You may find it useful to search through the files for certain HPXML elements or compare (diff) a sample file to the base.xml file.
