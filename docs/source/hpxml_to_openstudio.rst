HPXMLtoOpenStudio Measure
=========================

Introduction
------------

The HPXMLtoOpenStudio measure requires a building description in an `HPXML file <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/>`_ format.
HPXML is an open data standard for collecting and transferring home energy data. 
Using HPXML files reduces the complexity and effort for software developers to leverage the EnergyPlus simulation engine.

EnergyPlus Use Case for HPXML
*****************************

HPXML is an flexible and extensible format, where nearly all elements in the schema are optional and custom elements can be included.
Because of this, an EnergyPlus Use Case for HPXML has been developed that specifies the HPXML elements or enumeration choices required to run the measure.

Software developers should use the EnergyPlus Use Case (found at ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/EPvalidator.rb``, which defines sets of conditional XPath expressions) as well as the HPXML schema (HPXML.xsd) to construct valid HPXML files for EnergyPlus simulations.

The `HPXML Toolbox website <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/>`_ also provides several resources for software developers, including:

#. An interactive schema validator
#. A data dictionary
#. An implementation guide

Input Defaults
**************

An increasing number of elements in the HPXML file are being made optional with "smart" defaults.
Default values, equations, and logic are described throughout this documentation.

Most defaults can also be seen by using the ``debug`` argument/flag when running the workflow on an actual HPXML file.
This will create a new HPXML file (``in.xml`` in the run directory) where additional fields are populated for inspection.

For example, suppose a HPXML file has a window defined as follows:

.. code-block:: XML

  <Window>
    <SystemIdentifier id='Window'/>
    <Area>108.0</Area>
    <Azimuth>0</Azimuth>
    <UFactor>0.33</UFactor>
    <SHGC>0.45</SHGC>
    <AttachedToWall idref='Wall'/>
  </Window>

In the ``in.xml`` file, the window would have additional elements like so:

.. code-block:: XML

  <Window>
    <SystemIdentifier id='Window'/>
    <Area>108.0</Area>
    <Azimuth>0</Azimuth>
    <UFactor>0.33</UFactor>
    <SHGC>0.45</SHGC>
    <InteriorShading>
      <SystemIdentifier id='WindowInteriorShading'/>
      <SummerShadingCoefficient>0.7</SummerShadingCoefficient>
      <WinterShadingCoefficient>0.85</WinterShadingCoefficient>
    </InteriorShading>
    <FractionOperable>0.67</FractionOperable>
    <AttachedToWall idref='Wall'/>
  </Window>

.. warning::

  The OpenStudio-HPXML workflow generally treats missing HPXML elements differently than elements provided but without additional detail.
  For example, if an HPXML file has no ``Refrigerator`` element defined, it will be interpreted as a building that has no refrigerator and modeled this way.
  On the other hand, if there is a ``Refrigerator`` element defined but no elements within, it is interpreted as a building that has a refrigerator, but no information about the refrigerator is known.
  In this case, its details (e.g., location, energy use) will be defaulted in the model.

HPXML Software Info
-------------------

EnergyPlus simulation controls can be entered in ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/SimulationControl``.

The simulation timestep can be optionally provided as ``Timestep``, where the value is in minutes and must be a divisor of 60.
If not provided, the default value of 60 (i.e., 1 hour) is used.

The simulation run period can be optionally specified with ``BeginMonth``/``BeginDayOfMonth`` and/or ``EndMonth``/``EndDayOfMonth``.
The ``BeginMonth``/``BeginDayOfMonth`` provided must occur before ``EndMonth``/``EndDayOfMonth`` provided (e.g., a run period from 10/1 to 3/31 is invalid).
If not provided, default values of January 1st and December 31st will be used.

Whether to apply daylight saving time can be optionally denoted with ``DaylightSaving/Enabled``.
If either ``DaylightSaving`` or ``DaylightSaving/Enabled`` is not provided, ``DaylightSaving/Enabled`` will default to true.
If daylight saving is enabled, the daylight saving period can be optionally specified with ``DaylightSaving/BeginMonth``, ``DaylightSaving/BeginDayOfMonth``, ``DaylightSaving/EndMonth``, and ``DaylightSaving/EndDayOfMonth``.
If not specified, dates will be defined according to the EPW weather file header; if not available there, default values of March 12 and November 5 will be used.

HPXML Building Details
----------------------

The building description is entered in HPXML's ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails``.

HPXML Building Summary
----------------------

This section describes elements specified in HPXML's ``BuildingSummary``. 
These elements include ``Site``, ``BuildingOccupancy``, and ``BuildingConstruction``.

HPXML Site
**********

The ``Site`` element is used to describe the terrain and local shelter conditions as well as the presence of neighbors.

The terrain surrounding the building can be optionally entered as ``Site/SiteType``; if not provided, it is assumed to be "suburban".

The local shelter coefficient can be entered as ``Site/extension/ShelterCoefficient``.
The shelter coefficient is defined by the AIM-2 infiltration model to account for nearby buildings, trees and obstructions.
If not provided, the value of 0.5 will be assumed.

===================  =========================================================================
Shelter Coefficient  Description
===================  =========================================================================
1.0                  No obstructions or local shielding
0.9                  Light local shielding with few obstructions within two building heights
0.7                  Local shielding with many large obstructions within two building heights
0.5                  Heavily shielded, many large obstructions within one building height
0.3                  Complete shielding with large buildings immediately adjacent
===================  =========================================================================

Shading due to neighboring buildings can be defined inside an ``extension/Neighbors`` element.
Each ``Neighbors/NeighborBuilding`` element is required to have an ``Azimuth`` and ``Distance`` from the house.
A ``Height`` is also optionally allowed; if not provided, the neighboring building is assumed to have the same height as the house.

HPXML Building Occupancy
************************

The ``BuildingOccupancy`` element is used to describe the occupants.

The number of occupants can be optionally provided as ``NumberofResidents``; if not provided, it is assumed that the number of occupants equal the number of bedrooms.

.. note::

  Most occupancy assumptions (e.g., plug loads, appliance usage, hot water usage, etc.) are based on the number of bedrooms. The number of residents is solely used to determine heat gains from the occupants themselves.

HPXML Building Construction
***************************

The ``BuildingConstruction`` element is used to describe high-level building information.
Fields include:

- ``ResidentialFacilityType``: "single-family detached", "single-family attached", "apartment unit", or "manufactured home"
- ``NumberofConditionedFloors``
- ``NumberofConditionedFloorsAboveGrade``: Note that this should include a walkout basement if present.
- ``NumberofBedrooms``
- ``NumberofBathrooms``: Optional. If not provided, it is calculated as :math:`\frac{NumberofBedrooms}{2} + 0.5` based on the `Building America House Simulation Protocols <https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/building_america/house_simulation.pdf>`_.
- ``ConditionedFloorArea``
- ``ConditionedBuildingVolume`` or ``AverageCeilingHeight``
- ``extension/HasFlueOrChimney``: Optional. Specifies whether there is a flue (associated with heating system or water heater) or chimney. if not provided, it is assumed to be true if any of the following conditions are met: 

  - heating system is non-electric ``Furnace``, ``Boiler``, ``WallFurnace``, ``FloorFurnace``, ``Stove``, or ``FixedHeater`` and AFUE/Percent is less than 0.89
  - heating system is non-electric ``Fireplace`` 
  - water heater is non-electric with energy factor (or equivalent calculated from uniform energy factor) less than 0.63

HPXML Weather Station
---------------------

The ``ClimateandRiskZones/WeatherStation`` element specifies the EnergyPlus weather file (EPW) to be used in the simulation.
The weather file can be entered in one of two ways:

#. Using ``WeatherStation/WMO``, which must be one of the acceptable TMY3 WMO station numbers found in the ``weather/data.csv`` file.
   The full set of U.S. TMY3 weather files can be `downloaded here <https://data.nrel.gov/system/files/128/tmy3s-cache-csv.zip>`_.
#. Using ``WeatherStation/extension/EPWFilePath``.

HPXML Enclosure
---------------

This section describes elements specified in HPXML's ``Enclosure``.

All surfaces that bound different space types in the building (i.e., not just thermal boundary surfaces) must be specified in the HPXML file.
For example, an attached garage would generally be defined by walls adjacent to conditioned space, walls adjacent to outdoors, a slab, and a roof or ceiling.
For software tools that do not collect sufficient inputs for every required surface, the software developers will need to make assumptions about these surfaces or collect additional input.

The space types used in the HPXML building description are:

==============================  ================================================  ========================================================  =========================
Space Type                      Description                                       Temperature                                               Building Type

other non-freezing space        E.g., shared parking garage ceiling               Floats with outside; minimum of 40F                       Attached/Multifamily only
==============================  ================================================  ========================================================  =========================

.. warning::

  It is the software tool's responsibility to provide the appropriate building surfaces. 
  While some error-checking is in place, it is not possible to know whether some surfaces are incorrectly missing.

Also note that wall and roof surfaces do not require an azimuth to be specified. 
Rather, only the windows/skylights themselves require an azimuth. 
Thus, software tools can choose to use a single wall (or roof) surface to represent multiple wall (or roof) surfaces for the entire building if all their other properties (construction type, interior/exterior adjacency, etc.) are identical.

HPXML Air Infiltration
**********************

Building air leakage is entered using ``Enclosure/AirInfiltration/AirInfiltrationMeasurement``.
Air leakage can be provided in one of three ways:

#. nACH (natural air changes per hour): Use ``BuildingAirLeakage/UnitofMeasure='ACHnatural'``.
#. ACH (air changes per hour at user-specified pressure): Use ``BuildingAirLeakage/UnitofMeasure='ACH'`` and ``HousePressure``. Pressure is typically 50 Pa.
#. CFM (cubic feet per minute at user-specified pressure): Use ``BuildingAirLeakage/UnitofMeasure='CFM'`` and ``HousePressure``. Pressure is typically 50 Pa.

In addition, the building's volume associated with the air leakage measurement can be provided in HPXML's ``AirInfiltrationMeasurement/InfiltrationVolume``.
If not provided, the infiltration volume is assumed to be equal to the conditioned building volume.

HPXML Attics/Foundations
*************************

The ventilation rate for vented attics (or vented crawlspaces) can be specified using an ``Attic`` (or ``Foundation``) element.
First, define the ``AtticType`` as ``Attic[Vented='true']`` (or ``FoundationType`` as ``Crawlspace[Vented='true']``).
Then specify the specific leakage area (SLA) using the ``VentilationRate[UnitofMeasure='SLA']/Value`` element.
For vented attics, the natural air changes per hour (nACH) can instead be specified using ``UnitofMeasure='ACHnatural'``.
If the ventilation rate is not provided, default values of SLA=1/300 for vented attics and SLA=1/150 for vented crawlspaces will be used based on `ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2019 <https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/RESNETICC3012019>`_.

HPXML Roofs
***********

Pitched or flat roof surfaces that are exposed to ambient conditions should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Roofs/Roof``. 
For a multifamily building where the dwelling unit has another dwelling unit above it, the surface between the two dwelling units should be considered a ``FrameFloor`` and not a ``Roof``.

Roofs are defined by their ``Area``, ``Pitch``, ``Insulation/AssemblyEffectiveRValue``, ``SolarAbsorptance``, and ``Emittance``.

Roofs must have either ``RoofColor`` and/or ``SolarAbsorptance`` defined.
If ``RoofColor`` or ``SolarAbsorptance`` is not provided, it is defaulted based on the mapping below:

=========== ======================================================= ================
RoofColor   RoofMaterial                                            SolarAbsorptance
=========== ======================================================= ================
dark        asphalt or fiberglass shingles, wood shingles or shakes 0.92
medium dark asphalt or fiberglass shingles, wood shingles or shakes 0.89
medium      asphalt or fiberglass shingles, wood shingles or shakes 0.85
light       asphalt or fiberglass shingles, wood shingles or shakes 0.75
reflective  asphalt or fiberglass shingles, wood shingles or shakes 0.50
dark        slate or tile shingles, metal surfacing                 0.90
medium dark slate or tile shingles, metal surfacing                 0.83
medium      slate or tile shingles, metal surfacing                 0.75
light       slate or tile shingles, metal surfacing                 0.60
reflective  slate or tile shingles, metal surfacing                 0.30
=========== ======================================================= ================

Roofs can also have optional elements provided for ``RadiantBarrier and ``RoofType``.
If ``RadiantBarrier`` is not provided, it is defaulted to not present; if it is provided, ``RadiantBarrierGrade`` must also be provided.
If ``RoofType`` is not provided, it is defaulted to "asphalt or fiberglass shingles".

HPXML Rim Joists
****************

Rim joists, the perimeter of floor joists typically found between stories of a building or on top of a foundation wall, are specified as an ``Enclosure/RimJoists/RimJoist``.
The ``InteriorAdjacentTo`` element should typically be "living space" for rim joists between stories of a building and "basement - conditioned", "basement - unconditioned", "crawlspace - vented", or "crawlspace - unvented" for rim joists on top of a foundation wall.

Rim joists are defined by their ``Area`` and ``Insulation/AssemblyEffectiveRValue``.

Rim joists must have either ``Color`` and/or ``SolarAbsorptance`` defined.
If ``Color`` or ``SolarAbsorptance`` is not provided, it is defaulted based on the mapping below:

=========== ================
Color       SolarAbsorptance
=========== ================
dark        0.95
medium dark 0.85
medium      0.70
light       0.50
reflective  0.30
=========== ================

Rim joists can have an optional element provided for ``Siding``; if not provided, it defaults to "wood siding".

HPXML Walls
***********

Any wall that has no contact with the ground and bounds a space type should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Walls/Wall``. 
Interior walls (for example, walls solely within the conditioned space of the building) are not required.

Walls are defined by their ``Area`` and ``Insulation/AssemblyEffectiveRValue``.
The choice of ``WallType`` has a secondary effect on heat transfer in that it informs the assumption of wall thermal mass.

Walls must have either ``Color`` and/or ``SolarAbsorptance`` defined.
If ``Color`` or ``SolarAbsorptance`` is not provided, it is defaulted based on the mapping below:

=========== ================
Color       SolarAbsorptance
=========== ================
dark        0.95
medium dark 0.85
medium      0.70
light       0.50
reflective  0.30
=========== ================

Walls can have an optional element provided for ``Siding``; if not provided, it defaults to "wood siding".

HPXML Foundation Walls
**********************

Any wall that is in contact with the ground should be specified as an ``Enclosure/FoundationWalls/FoundationWall``.
Other walls (e.g., wood framed walls) that are connected to a below-grade space but have no contact with the ground should be specified as ``Walls`` and not ``FoundationWalls``.

*Exterior* foundation walls (i.e., those that fall along the perimeter of the building's footprint) should use "ground" for ``ExteriorAdjacentTo`` and the appropriate space type (e.g., "basement - unconditioned") for ``InteriorAdjacentTo``.

*Interior* foundation walls should be specified with two appropriate space types (e.g., "crawlspace - vented" and "garage", or "basement - unconditioned" and "crawlspace - unvented") for ``InteriorAdjacentTo`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo``.
Interior foundation walls should never use "ground" for ``ExteriorAdjacentTo`` even if the foundation wall has some contact with the ground due to the difference in below-grade depths of the two adjacent space types.

Foundations must include a ``Height`` as well as a ``DepthBelowGrade``. 
For exterior foundation walls, the depth below grade is relative to the ground plane.
For interior foundation walls, the depth below grade **should not** be thought of as relative to the ground plane, but rather as the depth of foundation wall in contact with the ground.
For example, an interior foundation wall between an 8 ft conditioned basement and a 3 ft crawlspace has a height of 8 ft and a depth below grade of 5 ft.
Alternatively, an interior foundation wall between an 8 ft conditioned basement and an 8 ft unconditioned basement has a height of 8 ft and a depth below grade of 0 ft.

Foundation wall insulation can be described in two ways: 

Option 1. Both interior and exterior continuous insulation layers with ``NominalRValue``, ``extension/DistanceToTopOfInsulation``, and ``extension/DistanceToBottomOfInsulation``. 
Insulation layers are particularly useful for describing foundation wall insulation that doesn't span the entire height (e.g., 4 ft of insulation for an 8 ft conditioned basement). 
If there is not insulation on the interior and/or exterior of the foundation wall, the continuous insulation layer must still be provided -- with the nominal R-value, etc., set to zero.
When insulation is specified with option 1, it is modeled with a concrete wall (whose ``Thickness`` is provided) as well as air film resistances as appropriate.

Option 2. An ``AssemblyEffectiveRValue``. 
The assembly effective R-value should include the concrete wall and an interior air film resistance. 
The exterior air film resistance (for any above-grade exposure) or any soil thermal resistance should **not** be included.

HPXML Frame Floors
******************

Any horizontal floor/ceiling surface that is not in contact with the ground (Slab) nor adjacent to ambient conditions above (Roof) should be specified as an ``Enclosure/FrameFloors/FrameFloor``.
Frame floors in an attached/multifamily building that are adjacent to "other housing unit", "other heated space", "other multifamily buffer space", or "other non-freezing space" must have the ``extension/OtherSpaceAboveOrBelow`` property set to signify whether the other space is "above" or "below".

Frame floors are primarily defined by their ``Insulation/AssemblyEffectiveRValue``.

HPXML Slabs
***********

Any space type that borders the ground should include an ``Enclosure/Slabs/Slab`` surface with the appropriate ``InteriorAdjacentTo``. 
This includes basements, crawlspaces (even when there are dirt floors -- use zero for the ``Thickness``), garages, and slab-on-grade foundations.

A primary input for a slab is its ``ExposedPerimeter``. 
The exposed perimeter should include any slab length that falls along the perimeter of the building's footprint (i.e., is exposed to ambient conditions).
So, a basement slab edge adjacent to a garage or crawlspace, for example, should not be included.

Vertical insulation adjacent to the slab can be described by a ``PerimeterInsulation/Layer/NominalRValue`` and a ``PerimeterInsulationDepth``.

Horizontal insulation under the slab can be described by a ``UnderSlabInsulation/Layer/NominalRValue``. 
The insulation can either have a fixed width (``UnderSlabInsulationWidth``) or can span the entire slab (``UnderSlabInsulationSpansEntireSlab``).

For foundation types without walls, the ``DepthBelowGrade`` element must be provided.
For foundation types with walls, the ``DepthBelowGrade`` element is not used; instead the slab's position relative to grade is determined by the ``FoundationWall/DepthBelowGrade`` values.

HPXML Windows
*************

Any window or glass door area should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Windows/Window``.

Windows are defined by *full-assembly* NFRC ``UFactor`` and ``SHGC``, as well as ``Area``.
Windows must reference a HPXML ``Enclosures/Walls/Wall`` element via the ``AttachedToWall``.
Windows must also have an ``Azimuth`` specified, even if the attached wall does not.

In addition, the summer/winter interior shading coefficients can be optionally entered as ``InteriorShading/SummerShadingCoefficient`` and ``InteriorShading/WinterShadingCoefficient``.
The summer interior shading coefficient must be less than or equal to the winter interior shading coefficient.
Note that a value of 0.7 indicates a 30% reduction in solar gains (i.e., 30% shading).
If not provided, default values of 0.70 for summer and 0.85 for winter will be used based on `ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2019 <https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/RESNETICC3012019>`_.

Overhangs (e.g., a roof eave) can optionally be defined for a window by specifying a ``Window/Overhangs`` element.
Overhangs are defined by the vertical distance between the overhang and the top of the window (``DistanceToTopOfWindow``), and the vertical distance between the overhang and the bottom of the window (``DistanceToBottomOfWindow``).
The difference between these two values equals the height of the window.

Finally, windows can be optionally described with ``FractionOperable``.
The input should solely reflect whether the windows are operable (can be opened), not how they are used by the occupants.
If a ``Window`` represents a single window, the value should be 0 or 1.
If a ``Window`` represents multiple windows (e.g., 4), the value should be between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1).
If not provided, it is assumed that 67% of the windows are operable.
The total open window area for natural ventilation is thus calculated using A) the fraction of windows that are operable, B) the assumption that 50% of the area of operable windows can be open, and C) the assumption that 20% of that openable area is actually opened by occupants whenever outdoor conditions are favorable for cooling.

HPXML Skylights
***************

Any skylight should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Skylights/Skylight``.

Skylights are defined by *full-assembly* NFRC ``UFactor`` and ``SHGC``, as well as ``Area``.
Skylights must reference a HPXML ``Enclosures/Roofs/Roof`` element via the ``AttachedToRoof``.
Skylights must also have an ``Azimuth`` specified, even if the attached roof does not.

In addition, the summer/winter interior shading coefficients can be optionally entered as ``InteriorShading/SummerShadingCoefficient`` and ``InteriorShading/WinterShadingCoefficient``.
The summer interior shading coefficient must be less than or equal to the winter interior shading coefficient.
Note that a value of 0.7 indicates a 30% reduction in solar gains (i.e., 30% shading).
If not provided, default values of 1.0 for summer and 1.0 for winter will be used.

HPXML Doors
***********

Any opaque doors should be specified as an ``Enclosure/Doors/Door``.

Doors are defined by ``RValue`` and ``Area``.
Doors must reference a HPXML ``Enclosures/Walls/Wall`` element via the ``AttachedToWall``.
Doors must also have an ``Azimuth`` specified, even if the attached wall does not.

HPXML Systems
-------------

This section describes elements specified in HPXML's ``Systems``.

If any HVAC systems are entered that provide heating (or cooling), the sum of all their ``FractionHeatLoadServed`` (or ``FractionCoolLoadServed``) values must be less than or equal to 1.
For example, a room air conditioner might be specified with ``FractionCoolLoadServed`` equal to 0.3 if it serves 30% of the home's conditioned floor area.

If any water heating systems are entered, the sum of all their ``FractionDHWLoadServed`` values must be equal to 1.

HPXML Heating Systems
*********************

Each heating system (other than heat pumps) should be entered as a ``Systems/HVAC/HVACPlant/HeatingSystem``.
Inputs including ``HeatingSystemType``, and ``FractionHeatLoadServed`` must be provided.
``HeatingCapacity`` may be provided; if not, the system will be auto-sized via ACCA Manual J/S.

Depending on the type of heating system specified, additional elements are used:

Validating & Debugging Errors
-----------------------------

When running HPXML files, errors may occur because:

#. An HPXML file provided is invalid (either relative to the HPXML schema or the EnergyPlus Use Case).
#. An unexpected EnergyPlus simulation error occurred.

If an error occurs, first look in the run.log for details.
If there are no errors in that log file, then the error may be in the EnergyPlus simulation -- see eplusout.err.

Contact us if you can't figure out the cause of an error.

Sample Files
------------

Dozens of sample HPXML files are included in the workflow/sample_files directory.
The sample files help to illustrate how different building components are described in HPXML.

Each sample file generally makes one isolated change relative to the base HPXML (base.xml) building.
For example, the base-dhw-dwhr.xml file adds a ``DrainWaterHeatRecovery`` element to the building.

You may find it useful to search through the files for certain HPXML elements or compare (diff) a sample file to the base.xml file.
