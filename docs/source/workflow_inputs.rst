Workflow Inputs
===============

OpenStudio-HPXML requires a building description in an `HPXML file <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/>`_ format.
HPXML is an open data standard for collecting and transferring home energy data. 
Using HPXML files reduces the complexity and effort for software developers to leverage the EnergyPlus simulation engine.

Using HPXML
-----------

HPXML is an flexible and extensible format, where nearly all elements in the schema are optional and custom elements can be included.
Because of this, a stricter set of requirements for the HPXML file have been developed for purposes of running EnergyPlus simulations.

HPXML files submitted to OpenStudio-HPXML undergo a two step validation process:

1. Validation against the HPXML Schema

  The HPXML XSD Schema can be found at ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/hpxml_schema/HPXML.xsd``.
  XSD Schemas are used to validate what elements/attributes/enumerations are available, data types for elements/attributes, the number/order of children elements, etc.

2. Validation using `Schematron <http://schematron.com/>`_

  The Schematron document for the EnergyPlus use case can be found at ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/hpxml_schematron/EPvalidator.xml``.
  Schematron is a rule-based validation language, expressed in XML using XPath expressions, for validating the presence or absence of inputs in XML files. 
  As opposed to an XSD Schema, a Schematron document validates constraints and requirements based on conditionals and other logical statements.
  For example, if an element is specified with a particular value, the applicable enumerations of another element may change.

OpenStudio-HPXML **automatically validates** the HPXML file against both the XSD and Schematron documents and reports any validation errors, but software developers may find it beneficial to also integrate validation into their software.

.. important::

  Usage of both validation approaches (XSD and Schematron) is recommended for developers actively working on creating HPXML files for EnergyPlus simulations:

  - Validation against XSD for general correctness and usage of HPXML
  - Validation against Schematron for understanding XML document requirements specific to running EnergyPlus

Input Defaults
**************

A large number of elements in the HPXML file are optional and can be defaulted.
Default values, equations, and logic are described throughout this documentation.

For example, suppose a HPXML file has a refrigerator defined as follows:

.. code-block:: XML

  <Refrigerator>
    <SystemIdentifier id='Refrigerator1'/>
  </Refrigerator>

Default values would be used for the refrigerator energy use, location, and schedule:

.. code-block:: XML

  <Refrigerator>
    <SystemIdentifier id='Refrigerator1'/>
    <Location dataSource='software'>living space</Location>
    <RatedAnnualkWh dataSource='software'>691.0</RatedAnnualkWh>
    <PrimaryIndicator dataSource='software'>true</PrimaryIndicator>
    <extension>
      <UsageMultiplier dataSource='software'>1.0</UsageMultiplier>
      <WeekdayScheduleFractions dataSource='software'>0.040, 0.039, 0.038, 0.037, 0.036, 0.036, 0.038, 0.040, 0.041, 0.041, 0.040, 0.040, 0.042, 0.042, 0.042, 0.041, 0.044, 0.048, 0.050, 0.048, 0.047, 0.046, 0.044, 0.041</WeekdayScheduleFractions>
      <WeekendScheduleFractions dataSource='software'>0.040, 0.039, 0.038, 0.037, 0.036, 0.036, 0.038, 0.040, 0.041, 0.041, 0.040, 0.040, 0.042, 0.042, 0.042, 0.041, 0.044, 0.048, 0.050, 0.048, 0.047, 0.046, 0.044, 0.041</WeekendScheduleFractions>
      <MonthlyScheduleMultipliers dataSource='software'>0.837, 0.835, 1.084, 1.084, 1.084, 1.096, 1.096, 1.096, 1.096, 0.931, 0.925, 0.837</MonthlyScheduleMultipliers>
    </extension>
  </Refrigerator>

These defaults will be reflected in the EnergyPlus simulation results.

 .. note::

  The OpenStudio-HPXML workflow generally treats missing *elements* differently than missing *values*.
  For example, if there is no ``Refrigerator`` element defined, the model will proceed without refrigerator energy use.
  On the other hand, if there is a ``Refrigerator`` element but with no values defined (i.e., no ``Location`` or ``RatedAnnualkWh``), it is assumed that a refrigerator exists but its properties are unknown, so they will be defaulted in the model.

See :ref:`hpxml_defaults` for information on how default values can be inspected.

  .. [#] CalendarYear only applies to TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) weather. For AMY (Actual Meteorological Year) weather, the AMY year will be used regardless of what is specified.
  .. [#] TemperatureCapacitanceMultiplier affects the transient calculation of indoor air temperatures.
         Values greater than 1.0 have the effect of smoothing or damping the rate of change in the indoor air temperature from timestep to timestep.
         This heat capacitance effect is modeled on top of any other individual mass inputs (e.g., furniture mass, partition wall mass, interior drywall, etc.) in the HPXML.

HPXML HVAC Sizing Control

  .. [#] If AllowIncreasedFixedCapacities is true, the larger of user-specified fixed capacity and design load will be used (to reduce potential for unmet loads); otherwise user-specified fixed capacity is used.
  .. [#] HeatPumpSizingMethodology choices are 'ACCA', 'HERS', or 'MaxLoad'.
  .. [#] If HeatPumpSizingMethodology is 'ACCA', autosized heat pumps have their nominal capacity sized per ACCA Manual J/S based on cooling design loads, with some oversizing allowances for larger heating design loads.
         If HeatPumpSizingMethodology is 'HERS', autosized heat pumps have their nominal capacity sized equal to the larger of heating/cooling design loads.
         If HeatPumpSizingMethodology is 'MaxLoad', autosized heat pumps have their nominal capacity sized based on the larger of heating/cooling design loads, while taking into account the heat pump's reduced capacity at the design temperature.

HPXML Schedules
***************

Schedules for a variety of building features can be 1) specified via simple inputs, 2) specified via detailed inputs, or 3) defaulted.
It is allowed to use simple, detailed, and defaulted values in the same HPXML run.

Simple Schedule Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple schedule inputs are available as weekday/weekend fractions and monthly multipliers for a variety of building characteristics.
For example, see the ``WeekdayScheduleFractions``, ``WeekendScheduleFractions``, and ``MonthlyScheduleMultipliers`` inputs for :ref:`buildingoccupancy`.

.. _detailedschedules:

Detailed Schedule Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Detailed schedule inputs allow schedule values for every hour or timestep of the simulation.
They can be used to reflect real-world or stochastic occupancy.

Detailed schedule inputs are provided via one or more CSV file that should be referenced in the HPXML file as ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/SchedulesFilePath`` elements.

  ===============================  =====  ==============================================================================  ===============================

Columns with units of `frac` must be normalized to MAX=1; that is, these schedules only define *when* energy is used, not *how much* energy is used.
In other words, the amount of energy or hot water used in each simulation timestep is essentially the schedule value divided by the sum of all schedule values in the column, multiplied by the annual energy or hot water use.
Example schedule CSV files are provided in the ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/schedule_files`` directory.

The schedule file must have a full year of data even if the simulation is not an entire year.
Frequency of schedule values do not need to match the simulation timestep.
For example, hourly schedules can be used with a 10-minute simulation timestep, or 10-minute schedules can be used with an hourly simulation timestep.

A detailed stochastic occupancy schedule CSV file can also be automatically generated for you (see "Can Be Stochastically Generated" above for applicable columns); see the :ref:`usage_instructions` for the commands.
Inputs for the stochastic schedule generator are entered in ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/BuildingSummary/BuildingOccupancy/NumberofResidents`` and ``/HPXML/Building/Site/Address/StateCode``.
See :ref:`buildingoccupancy` and :ref:`buildingsite` for more information.

.. warning::

  For simulations with daylight saving enabled (which is the default), EnergyPlus will skip forward an hour in the CSV on the "spring forward" day and repeat an hour on the "fall back" day.

Default Schedules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If neither simple nor detailed inputs are provided, then schedules are defaulted.
Default schedules are typically smooth, averaged schedules.
These default schedules are described elsewhere in the documentation (e.g., see :ref:`buildingoccupancy` for the default occupant heat gain schedule).

HPXML Occupancy Calculation Type
********************************

The occupancy calculation type is entered in ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/OccupancyCalculationType``: either "asset" or "operational"; it defaults to "asset".

If OccupancyCalculationType is "asset", various end uses (e.g., clothes washer) are calculated using number of bedrooms and/or conditioned floor area.

If OccupancyCalculationType is "operational", end uses based on number of bedrooms are adjusted for the number of occupants using the relationship from `RECS 2015 <https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2015/overview/>`_:

- single-family detached or manufactured home: NumberofBedrooms = -1.47 + 1.69 * NumberofResidents
- single-family attached or apartment unit: NumberofBedrooms = -0.68 + 1.09 * NumberofResidents

HPXML Emissions Scenarios

Electricity Rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each scenario, electricity rates can be optionally entered as an ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/UtilityBillScenarios/UtilityBillScenario/UtilityRate``.
Electricity rates can be entered using Simple inputs or Detailed inputs.

**Simple**

For simple utility rate structures, inputs can be entered using a fixed charge and a marginal rate.

  ================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ========  ====================

  .. [#] If MarginalRate not provided, defaults to state, regional, or national average based on EIA data that can be found at ``ReportUtilityBills/resources/Data/UtilityRates/Average_retail_price_of_electricity.csv``.

**Detailed**

For detailed utility rate structures, inputs can be entered using a tariff JSON file.

  ================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ========  =============================
  Element                           Type      Units    Constraints  Required  Default   Notes

  ================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ========  =============================

  .. [#] TariffFilePath must point to a JSON file with utility rate structure information.
         Tariff files can describe flat, tiered, time-of-use, tiered time-of-use, or real-time pricing rates.
         Sources of tariff files include `OpenEI's U.S. Utility Rate Database (URDB) <https://openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database>`_;
         a large set of residential OpenEI URDB rates for U.S. utilities are included at ``ReportUtilityBills/resources/detailed_rates/openei_rates.zip``.
         Additional sample tariff files can be found in ``ReportUtilityBills/resources/detailed_rates``.
         Tariff files are formatted based on `OpenEI API version 7 <https://openei.org/services/doc/rest/util_rates/?version=7#response-fields>`_.

Fuel Rates
~~~~~~~~~~

For each scenario, fuel rates can be optionally entered as an ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/UtilityBillScenarios/UtilityBillScenario/UtilityRate``.

  ================================  ========  ========  ===========  ========  ========  ====================
  Element                           Type      Units     Constraints  Required  Default   Notes

  ================================  ========  ========  ===========  ========  ========  ====================

  .. [#] FuelType choices are "natural gas", "propane", "fuel oil", "coal", "wood", and "wood pellets".
  .. [#] FixedCharge defaults to $12/month for natural gas and $0/month for other fuels.
  .. [#] MarginalRate units are $/therm for natural gas, $/gallon for propane and fuel oil, and $/kBtu for other fuels.
  .. [#] If MarginalRate not provided, defaults to state, regional, or national average based on EIA data that can be found at:

         - natural gas: ``ReportUtilityBills/resources/Data/UtilityRates/NG_PRI_SUM_A_EPG0_PRS_DMCF_A.csv``
         - propane: ``ReportUtilityBills/resources/Data/UtilityRates/PET_PRI_WFR_A_EPLLPA_PRS_DPGAL_W.csv``

         or defaults to $0.015/kBtu for other fuels.

PV Compensation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each scenario, PV compensation information can be optionally entered in ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/UtilityBillScenarios/UtilityBillScenario/PVCompensation``.

  =============================================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ==============  ==============================
  Element                                                        Type      Units    Constraints  Required  Default         Notes
  =============================================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ==============  ==============================
  ``CompensationType[NetMetering | FeedInTariff]``               element                         No        NetMetering     PV compensation type

  =============================================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ==============  ==============================

**Net-Metering**

If the PV compensation type is net-metering, additional information can be entered in ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/UtilityBillScenarios/UtilityBillScenario/PVCompensation/CompensationType/NetMetering``.

  ================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ==============  =============================================================
  Element                           Type      Units    Constraints  Required  Default         Notes

  ================================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ==============  =============================================================
  
  .. [#] AnnualExcessSellbackRateType choices are "User-Specified" and "Retail Electricity Cost".
  .. [#] When annual PV production exceeds the annual building electricity consumption, this rate, which is often significantly below the retail rate, determines the value of the excess electricity sold back to the utility.
         This may happen to offset gas consumption, for example.
  .. [#] AnnualExcessSellbackRate is only used when AnnualExcessSellbackRateType="User-Specified".
  .. [#] Since modeled electricity consumption will not change from one year to the next, "indefinite rollover" of annual excess generation credit is best approximated by setting "User-Specified" and entering a rate of zero.

**Feed-in Tariff**

If the PV compensation type is feed-in tariff, additional information can be entered in ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension/UtilityBillScenarios/UtilityBillScenario/PVCompensation/CompensationType/FeedInTariff``.

  ============================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ==============  ========================
  Element                       Type      Units    Constraints  Required  Default         Notes

  ``FeedInTariffRate``          double    $/kWh                 No        0.12            Feed-in tariff rate [#]_
  ============================  ========  =======  ===========  ========  ==============  ========================

  .. [#] FeedInTariffRate applies to full (not excess) PV production.
         Some utilities/regions may have a feed-in tariff policy where compensation occurs for excess PV production (i.e., PV-generated electricity sent to the grid that is not immediately consumed by the building), rather than full PV production.
         OpenStudio-HPXML is currently unable to calculate utility bills for such a feed-in tariff policy.

HPXML Enclosure
---------------

The dwelling unit's enclosure is entered in ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/Enclosure``.

All surfaces that bound different space types of the dwelling unit (i.e., not just thermal boundary surfaces) must be specified in the HPXML file.
For example, an attached garage would generally be defined by walls adjacent to conditioned space, walls adjacent to outdoors, a slab, and a roof or ceiling.
For software tools that do not collect sufficient inputs for every required surface, the software developers will need to make assumptions about these surfaces or collect additional input.

Interior partition surfaces (e.g., walls between rooms inside conditioned space, or the floor between two conditioned stories) can be excluded.

For single-family attached (SFA) or multifamily (MF) buildings, surfaces between unconditioned space and the neighboring unit's same unconditioned space should set ``InteriorAdjacentTo`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo`` to the same value.
For example, a foundation wall between the unit's vented crawlspace and the neighboring unit's vented crawlspace would use ``InteriorAdjacentTo="crawlspace - vented"`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo="crawlspace - vented"``.

.. warning::

  It is the software tool's responsibility to provide the appropriate building surfaces. 
  While some error-checking is in place, it is not possible to know whether some surfaces are incorrectly missing.

Also note that wall and roof surfaces do not require an azimuth/orientation to be specified. 
Rather, only the windows/skylights themselves require an azimuth/orientation. 
Thus, software tools can choose to use a single wall (or roof) surface to represent multiple wall (or roof) surfaces for the entire building if all their other properties (construction type, interior/exterior adjacency, etc.) are identical.

  .. [#] FractionOperable reflects whether the windows are operable (can be opened), not how they are used by the occupants.
         If a ``Window`` represents a single window, the value should be 0 or 1.
         If a ``Window`` represents multiple windows (e.g., 4), the value should be between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1).
         The total open window area for natural ventilation is calculated using A) the operable fraction, B) the assumption that 50% of the area of operable windows can be open, and C) the assumption that 20% of that openable area is actually opened by occupants whenever outdoor conditions are favorable for cooling.

  .. [#] Blower airflow rate when operating in ventilation only mode (i.e., not heating or cooling mode), as a fraction of the maximum blower airflow rate.
         This value will depend on whether the blower fan can operate at reduced airflow rates during ventilation only operation.
         It is used to determine how much conditioned air is recirculated through ducts during ventilation only operation, resulting in additional duct losses.
         A value of zero will result in no conditioned air recirculation, and thus no additional duct losses.

.. note::

  CFIS systems are automated controllers that use the HVAC system's air handler fan to draw in outdoor air to meet an hourly ventilation target.
  CFIS systems are modeled as assuming they A) maximize the use of normal heating/cooling runtime operation to meet the hourly ventilation target, B) block the flow of outdoor air when the hourly ventilation target has been met, and C) provide additional runtime operation (via air handler fan or supplemental fan) to meet the remainder of the hourly ventilation target when space heating/cooling runtime alone is not sufficient.

 .. note::

  An unscheduled battery in a home with photovoltaics (PV) will be controlled using a simple control strategy designed to maximize on site consumption of energy. The battery will charge if PV production is greater than the building load and the battery is below its maximum capacity, while the battery will discharge if the building load is greater than PV production and the battery is above its minimum capacity.

  A battery can alternatively be controlled using :ref:`detailedschedules`, where charging and discharging schedules are defined. Positive schedule values control timing and magnitude of charging storage. Negative schedule values control timing and magnitude of discharging storage. Simultaneous charging and discharging of the battery is not allowed. The round trip efficiency affects charging; the reported charging rate will be larger than the schedule value by an amount equal to the losses due to the round trip efficiency.

  A battery in a home without PV or charging/discharging schedules is assumed to operate as backup and is not modeled.

HPXML Misc Loads
----------------

Miscellaneous loads are entered in ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/MiscLoads``.

HPXML Plug Loads
****************

Each type of plug load can be entered as a ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/MiscLoads/PlugLoad``.

It is required to include miscellaneous plug loads (PlugLoadType="other"), which represents all residual plug loads not explicitly captured elsewhere.
It is common to include television plug loads (PlugLoadType="TV other"), which represents all television energy use in the home.
It is less common to include the other plug load types, as they are less frequently found in homes.
If not entered, the simulation will not include that type of plug load.

Validating & Debugging Errors
-----------------------------

When running HPXML files, errors may occur because:

#. An HPXML file provided is invalid (either relative to the HPXML schema or the EnergyPlus Use Case).
#. An unexpected EnergyPlus simulation error occurred.

If an error occurs, first look in the run.log for details.
If there are no errors in that log file, then the error may be in the EnergyPlus simulation -- see eplusout.err.

Contact us if you can't figure out the cause of an error.

Sample Files
------------

Dozens of sample HPXML files are included in the workflow/sample_files directory.
The sample files help to illustrate how different building components are described in HPXML.

Each sample file generally makes one isolated change relative to the base HPXML (base.xml) building.
For example, the base-dhw-dwhr.xml file adds a ``DrainWaterHeatRecovery`` element to the building.

You may find it useful to search through the files for certain HPXML elements or compare (diff) a sample file to the base.xml file.
