Workflow Outputs
================

OpenStudio-HPXML generates a number of workflow outputs:

  =================================  ======================================
  File                               Notes
  =================================  ======================================
  results_annual.csv (or .json)      Summary annual outputs in either CSV or JSON formats. See :ref:`annual_outputs`.
  results_timeseries.csv (or .json)  Timeseries outputs in either CSV or JSON formats. See :ref:`timeseries_outputs`. Only generated if requested.
  in.idf                             The EnergyPlus input file.
  in.xml                             HPXML file populated with defaulted values (e.g., autosized HVAC capacities); defaults use the ``dataSource='software'`` attribute.
  in.osm                             The OpenStudio model file. Only generated if the ``debug`` argument is used.
  run.log                            Errors/warnings generated by the OpenStudio-HPXML workflow.
  eplusout.*                         Minimal E+ files (e.g., sql output, error file, etc.). ALL output files can be generated using the ``debug`` argument.

Annual Outputs
--------------

OpenStudio-HPXML will always generate an annual output file called results_annual.csv (or results_annual.json), co-located with the EnergyPlus output.
The file includes the following sections of output:

Annual Energy Consumption by Fuel Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current fuel uses are listed below.

   ==================================== ===========================

Annual Energy Consumption By End Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current end uses are listed below.

Note that all end uses are mutually exclusive -- the "Electricity: Heating" end use, for example, excludes energy reported in the "Electricity: Heating Fans/Pumps" end use.
So the sum of all end uses for a given fuel (e.g., sum of all "End Use: Natural Gas: \*") equal the above reported fuel use (e.g., "Fuel Use: Natural Gas: Total").

Annual Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current annual building loads are listed below.

   ===================================== ==================================================================
   Type                                  Notes
   ===================================== ==================================================================
   Load: Heating (MBtu)                  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Load: Cooling (MBtu)                  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Load: Hot Water: Delivered (MBtu)     Includes contributions by desuperheaters or solar thermal systems.
   Load: Hot Water: Tank Losses (MBtu)
   Load: Hot Water: Desuperheater (MBtu) Load served by the desuperheater.
   Load: Hot Water: Solar Thermal (MBtu) Load served by the solar thermal system.
   ===================================== ==================================================================

Annual Unmet Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current annual unmet building loads are listed below.

   ========================== =====
   Type                       Notes
   ========================== =====
   Unmet Load: Heating (MBtu)
   Unmet Load: Cooling (MBtu)
   ========================== =====

These numbers reflect the amount of heating/cooling load that is not met by the HVAC system, indicating the degree to which the HVAC system is undersized.
An HVAC system with sufficient capacity to perfectly maintain the thermostat setpoints will report an unmet load of zero.

Note that if a building has partial (or no) HVAC system, the unserved load will not be included in the unmet load outputs.
For example, if a building has a room air conditioner that meets 33% of the cooling load, the remaining 67% of the load is not included in the unmet load.
Rather, the unmet load is only the amount of load that the room AC *should* be serving but is not.

Peak Building Electricity

Annual Component Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**: This section is only available if the ``--add-component-loads`` argument is used.
The argument is not used by default for faster performance.

Component loads represent the estimated contribution of different building components to the annual heating/cooling building loads.
The sum of component loads for heating (or cooling) will roughly equal the annual heating (or cooling) building load reported above.

Current component loads disaggregated by Heating/Cooling are listed below.

Timeseries Outputs
------------------

OpenStudio-HPXML can optionally generate a timeseries output file.
The timeseries output file is called results_timeseries.csv (or results_timeseries.json) and co-located with the EnergyPlus output.

Depending on the outputs requested, the file may include:

   Hot Water Uses                      Water use for each end use type (in gallons).
   Total Loads                         Heating, cooling, and hot water loads (in kBtu) for the building.

   Unmet Loads                         Unmet heating and cooling loads (in kBtu) for the building.
   Zone Temperatures                   Average temperatures (in deg-F) for each space modeled (e.g., living space, attic, garage, basement, crawlspace, etc.).
   Airflows                            Airflow rates (in cfm) for infiltration, mechanical ventilation (including clothes dryer exhaust), natural ventilation, whole house fans.

   =================================== ==================================================================================================================================

Timeseries outputs can be one of the following frequencies: hourly, daily, monthly, or timestep (i.e., equal to the simulation timestep, which defaults to an hour but can be sub-hourly).

Timestamps in the output use the end-of-hour (or end-of-day for daily frequency, etc.) convention.
Most outputs will be summed over the hour (e.g., energy) but some will be averaged over the hour (e.g., temperatures, airflows).
