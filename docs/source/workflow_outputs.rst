OpenStudio-HPXML generates a number of workflow outputs:

  =============================================  ======================================
  File                                           Notes
  =============================================  ======================================
  in.xml                                         See :ref:`hpxml_defaults`. HPXML file populated with defaulted values (e.g., autosized HVAC capacities).
  in.idf                                         EnergyPlus input file.
  in.osm                                         OpenStudio model file. Only generated if the ``debug`` argument is used.
  results_annual.csv (or .json or .msgpack)      See :ref:`annual_outputs`. Simulation annual outputs, autosized HVAC capacities and design loads, etc. in CSV or JSON format.
  results_timeseries.csv (or .json or .msgpack)  See :ref:`timeseries_outputs`. Simulation timeseries outputs in CSV or JSON format. Only generated if requested.

  run.log                                        Errors/warnings generated by the OpenStudio-HPXML workflow.
  eplusout.*                                     EnergyPlus output files (e.g., msgpack output, error log). Defaults to a subset of possible files; use ``debug`` to produce ALL files.
  =============================================  ======================================

.. _hpxml_defaults:

HPXML Defaults
--------------

OpenStudio-HPXML will always generate an HPXML file called ``in.xml``, located in the run directory.
This file reflects the HPXML input file provided by the user but includes any default values that OpenStudio-HPXML has used.
These default values will all be tagged with the ``dataSource='software'`` attribute.

For example, suppose a central air conditioner is described in the HPXML input file like so:

.. code-block:: XML

  <HVACPlant>
    <CoolingSystem>
      <SystemIdentifier id='CoolingSystem1'/>
      <DistributionSystem idref='HVACDistribution1'/>
      <CoolingSystemType>central air conditioner</CoolingSystemType>
      <CoolingSystemFuel>electricity</CoolingSystemFuel>
      <FractionCoolLoadServed>1.0</FractionCoolLoadServed>
      <AnnualCoolingEfficiency>
        <Units>SEER</Units>
        <Value>13.0</Value>
      </AnnualCoolingEfficiency>
    </CoolingSystem>
  </HVACPlant>

The ``in.xml`` output file will include autosized HVAC capacities as well as some other details:

.. code-block:: XML
 
  <HVACPlant>
    <CoolingSystem>
      <SystemIdentifier id='CoolingSystem1'/>
      <DistributionSystem idref='HVACDistribution1'/>

Annual Outputs
--------------

OpenStudio-HPXML will always generate an annual output file called ``results_annual.csv`` (or ``results_annual.json`` or ``results_annual.msgpack``), located in the run directory.
The file includes the following sections of output:

   =====================================  ==================================================================
   Load: Heating: Delivered (MBtu)        Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Load: Cooling: Delivered (MBtu)        Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Load: Hot Water: Delivered (MBtu)      Includes contributions by desuperheaters or solar thermal systems.
   Load: Hot Water: Tank Losses (MBtu)
   Load: Hot Water: Desuperheater (MBtu)  Load served by the desuperheater.
   Load: Hot Water: Solar Thermal (MBtu)  Load served by the solar thermal system.
   =====================================  ==================================================================

Note that the "Delivered" loads represent the energy delivered by the HVAC/DHW system; if a system is significantly undersized, there will be unmet load not reflected by these values.

Annual Unmet Hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Annual unmet hours are listed below.

   =========================  =====
   Type                       Notes
   =========================  =====
   Unmet Hours: Heating (hr)  Number of hours where the heating setpoint is not maintained.
   Unmet Hours: Cooling (hr)  Number of hours where the cooling setpoint is not maintained.
   =========================  =====

These numbers reflect the number of hours during the heating/cooling season when the conditioned space temperature deviates more than 0.2 deg-C (0.36 deg-F) from the heating/cooling setpoint.

   Peak Load: Heating: Delivered (kBtu/hr)  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Peak Load: Cooling: Delivered (kBtu/hr)  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   =======================================  ==================================

Note that the "Delivered" peak loads represent the energy delivered by the HVAC system; if a system is significantly undersized, there will be unmet peak load not reflected by these values.

Annual Component Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**: This section is only available if the ``--add-component-loads`` argument is used.
The argument is not used by default for faster performance.

Component loads represent the estimated contribution of different building components to the annual heating/cooling building loads.
The sum of component loads for heating (or cooling) will roughly equal the annual heating (or cooling) building load reported above.

Component loads disaggregated by Heating/Cooling are listed below.

Timeseries Outputs
------------------

OpenStudio-HPXML can optionally generate a timeseries output file.
The timeseries output file is called ``results_timeseries.csv`` (or ``results_timeseries.json`` or ``results_timeseries.msgpack``) and located in the run directory.

Depending on the outputs requested, the file may include:

   ===================================  ==================================================================================================================================
   Type                                 Notes
   ===================================  ==================================================================================================================================
   Total Consumptions                   Energy use for building total.
   Fuel Consumptions                    Energy use for each fuel type (in kBtu for fossil fuels and kWh for electricity).
   End Use Consumptions                 Energy use for each end use type (in kBtu for fossil fuels and kWh for electricity).
   Emissions                            Emissions (e.g., CO2) for each scenario defined in the HPXML file.
   Emission Fuels                       Emissions (e.g., CO2) disaggregated by fuel type for each scenario defined in the HPXML file.
   Emission End Uses                    Emissions (e.g., CO2) disaggregated by end use for each scenario defined in the HPXML file.
   Hot Water Uses                       Water use for each end use type (in gallons).
   Total Loads                          Heating, cooling, and hot water loads (in kBtu) for the building.
   Component Loads                      Heating and cooling loads (in kBtu) disaggregated by component (e.g., Walls, Windows, Infiltration, Ducts, etc.).
   Unmet Hours                          Heating and cooling unmet hours.
   Zone Temperatures                    Zone temperatures (in deg-F) for each space (e.g., living space, attic, garage, basement, crawlspace, etc.) plus heating/cooling setpoints.
   Airflows                             Airflow rates (in cfm) for infiltration, mechanical ventilation (including clothes dryer exhaust), natural ventilation, whole house fans.
   Weather                              Weather file data including outdoor temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar.
   EnergyPlus Output Variables          These are optional and can be requested with the ReportSimulationOutput ``user_output_variables`` argument.
   ===================================  ==================================================================================================================================

Timeseries outputs can be one of the following frequencies: hourly, daily, monthly, or timestep (i.e., equal to the simulation timestep, which defaults to an hour but can be sub-hourly).

Timestamps in the output use the start-of-period convention unless you have requested the end-of-period timestamp convention.
Additional timestamp columns can be optionally requested that reflect daylight saving time (DST) and/or coordinated universal time (UTC).
Most outputs will be summed over the hour (e.g., energy) but some will be averaged over the hour (e.g., temperatures, airflows).

.. _bill_outputs:

Utility Bill Outputs
--------------------

OpenStudio-HPXML can optionally generate a utility bills output file.
The utility bills output file is called ``results_bills.csv`` (or ``results_bills.json`` or ``results_bills.msgpack``) and located in the run directory.

Results for each utility bill scenario defined in the HPXML file are listed as shown below.
Note that rows below with values of zero will be excluded.
