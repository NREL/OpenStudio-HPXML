Type: The backup type. Use 'integrated' to represent e.g. built-in electric strip heat or dual-fuel integrated furnace. Use 'separate' to represent e.g. electric baseboard or boiler (based on the Heating System 2).				
Fuel: The fuel type of the integrated backup.				
Heating Efficiency: The rated heating efficiency of the integrated backup.				
"Heating Lockout Temp: The temperature above which the heat pump backup system is disabled. If both this and a HP compressor lockout temperature are provided and use the same value, it essentially defines a switchover temperature (for, e.g., a dual-fuel heat pump)."
