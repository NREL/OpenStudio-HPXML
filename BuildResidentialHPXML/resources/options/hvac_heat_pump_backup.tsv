Separate Heating System	separate		
			
# Type: The backup type. Use 'integrated' to represent e.g. built-in electric strip heat or dual-fuel integrated furnace. Use 'separate' to represent e.g. electric baseboard or boiler (based on Heating System 2).			
# Fuel: The fuel type of the integrated backup.			
# Heating Efficiency: The rated heating efficiency of the integrated backup.
