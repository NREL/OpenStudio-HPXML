Leakage Units: The units for the duct leakage.										
Leakage to Outside Value: The leakage to outside value.										
Supply Insulation R-Value: The nominal insulation r-value of the supply ducts excluding air films. Use 0 for uninsulated ducts.										
"Supply Buried Insulation Level: Whether the supply ducts are buried in, e.g., attic loose-fill insulation. Use 'partially buried' if the insulation does not cover the top of the ducts. Use 'fully buried' if the insulation just covers the top of the ducts. Use 'deeply buried' if the insulation continues above the top of the ducts."										
"Supply Surface Area: The supply duct surface area, if known, in the given location."										
Supply Fraction Rectangular: The fraction of supply ducts that are rectangular (as opposed to round) if known. This affects the duct effective R-value used for modeling.										
Return Insulation R-Value: The nominal insulation r-value of the return ducts excluding air films. Use 0 for uninsulated ducts.										
"Return Buried Insulation Level: Whether the return ducts are buried in, e.g., attic loose-fill insulation. Use 'partially buried' if the insulation does not cover the top of the ducts. Use 'fully buried' if the insulation just covers the top of the ducts. Use 'deeply buried' if the insulation continues above the top of the ducts."										
"Return Surface Area: The return duct surface area, if known, in the given location."										
Return Fraction Rectangular: The fraction of return ducts that are rectangular (as opposed to round) if known. This affects the duct effective R-value used for modeling.
