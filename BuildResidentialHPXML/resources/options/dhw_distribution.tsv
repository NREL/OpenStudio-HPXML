# Pipe Insulation Nominal R-Value: Nominal R-value of the pipe insulation.							
# System Type: The type of hot water distribution system.							
"# Standard Piping Length: If the system type is Standard, the length of hot water piping from the hot water heater to the farthest hot water fixture, measured longitudinally from plans, assuming the hot water piping does not run diagonally, plus 10 feet of piping for each floor level, plus 5 feet of piping for unconditioned basements (if any)."							
"# Recirculation Control Type: If the system type is Recirculation, the type of hot water recirculation control, if any."							
"# Recirculation Piping Loop Length: If the system type is Recirculation, the recirculation loop length including both supply and return sides, measured longitudinally from plans, assuming the hot water piping does not run diagonally, plus 20 feet of piping for each floor level greater than one plus 10 feet of piping for unconditioned basements."							
"# Recirculation Branch Piping Length: If the system type is Recirculation, the length of the branch hot water piping from the recirculation loop to the farthest hot water fixture from the recirculation loop, measured longitudinally from plans, assuming the branch hot water piping does not run diagonally."							
"# Recirculation Pump Power: If the system type is Recirculation, the recirculation pump power."
