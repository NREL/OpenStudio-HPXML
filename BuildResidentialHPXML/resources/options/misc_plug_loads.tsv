# Annual Energy Use: The annual energy consumption of the plug loads.				
"# Usage Multiplier: Multiplier on the energy usage that can reflect, e.g., high/low usage occupants."				
# Sensible Fraction: Fraction of internal gains that are sensible.				
# Latent Fraction: Fraction of internal gains that are latent.
