Type: The type of system.																						
"Cooling Efficiency Type: The cooling efficiency type. Central HPs and Mini-Split HPs use SEER2 or SEER; Geothermal HPs, Packaged Terminal HPs, and Room HPs use EER."																						
Cooling Efficiency: The rated cooling efficiency.																						
"Cooling Compressor Type: The compressor type of the cooling system. Applies to Central HPs, Mini-Split HPs, and Geothermal HPs."																						
"Heating Efficiency Type: The heating efficiency type. Central HPs and Mini-Split HPs use HSPF2 or HSPF; Goethermal HPs, Packaged Terminal HPs, and Room HPs use COP."																						
Heating Efficiency: The rated heating efficiency.
