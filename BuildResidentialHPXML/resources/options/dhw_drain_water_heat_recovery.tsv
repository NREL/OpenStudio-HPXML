# Efficiency: The efficiency of the DWHR according to CSA 55.1.			
# Facilities Connected: Use 'one' if there are All Showers and only one of them is connected to the DWHR. Use 'all' if there is one shower and it's connected to the DWHR or there are two or more showers connected to the DWHR.			
# Equal Flow: True if the DWHR supplies pre-heated water to both the fixture cold water piping and the hot water heater potable supply piping. False if the DWHR only supply pre-heated water to the hot water heater potable supply piping.
