Airflow Defect Ratio: The airflow defect ratio is defined as (InstalledAirflow - DesignAirflow) / DesignAirflow per ANSI/RESNET/ACCA Standard 310. A value of zero means no airflow defect. Applies to Central Furnaces and Central and ducted Mini-Split ACs/HPs.		
Charge Defect Ratio: The refrigerant charge defect ratio is defined as (InstalledCharge - DesignCharge) / DesignCharge per ANSI/RESNET/ACCA Standard 310. Applies to Central and Mini-Split ACs/HPs.
